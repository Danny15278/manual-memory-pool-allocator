Memory Pools:
	- Fixed block sizes
	- Provides constant time (de)allocations in a preallocated buffer of memory.
	- Avoids memory fragmentation, with accurately sized blocks.

In C++, the developer needs to know the dimensions of each block in advance.
Maximum block count depends on runtime, but block sizes should be known at compile time.
